Have you ever thought that Minecraft is missing a light brown or skin-colored block? With this mod, you can obtain baked mud bricks and baked packed mud simply by smelting packed mud or mud bricks. These blocks have a unique color that we think is missing from vanilla Minecraft, making them perfect for creating ancient Roman buildings or Mediterranean houses and churches.

## Blocks added
- Baked Packed Mud
- Baked Mud Bricks
- Baked Mud Brick Stairs
- Baked Mud Brick Slab
- Baked Mud Brick Wall

## Crafting
You can get baked packed mud and baked mud bricks by smelting packed mud and mud bricks respectively. Alternatively, you can also get baked mud bricks by crafting 4 baked packed mud together.

You can craft stairs, slabs and walls the usual way, in the crafting table or the stonecutter using baked mud bricks. You can't smelt mud brick stairs/slabs/walls to get the baked version of them.

## Languages
The blocks are translated to English, Spanish and Catalan. Feel free to recommend more translations to other languages.
